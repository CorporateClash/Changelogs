### Beta v1.1.6.2

**Optimization**
- The following was introduced in v1.1.6, but we felt it was important enough to keep in the these Patch Notes as well since this patch came out shortly afterwards:
  - Corporate Clash now includes more optimizations!
    - This means you can expect a drastic increase in performance, especially on lower-end machines.
    - Please note that this optimization will only apply to Windows machines at the moment. Similar optimizations for Mac users will be coming in the near future!

**Tweaks**
- Some server maintenance happened in this patch that we hope improves stability when districts reset.

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed a crash that could occur when entering or exiting various Playgrounds.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when closing a whisper that was already closing
- Fixed a bug that would cause the Daily Task to disappear while walking down a street and using "END" to show your Tasks.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when Cogs were exploding in the Toonseltown Minigame.
- Fixed a Toonseltown Task bug that had Toons collect Mezzo Melodyland Treasures twice. 
  - It now properly has Toons get Acorn and Ice Cream Treasures.
