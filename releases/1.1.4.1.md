**Bugfixes**
- Fixed a rare crash with the Battle UI.
- Fixed an issue with Big Drop destroying Cogs that caused the movie to be longer than was intended.
- Fixed an issue where audio content packs utilizing `music.json` would cause crashes between zones if the music path was set to `None`.
- Fixed an issue where audio content packs required `audio/music.json` to be in a folder of the same name of the pack, within the pack.
  - The audio folder containing music.json should now be placed in the root folder, such that your content pack has an audio folder alongside all the phase folders.
