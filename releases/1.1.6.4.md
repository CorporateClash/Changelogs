### Beta v1.1.6.4

**Optimization**
- The following was introduced in v1.1.6, but we felt it was important enough to keep in the next Patch Notes as well since this patch came out shortly afterwards:
  - Corporate Clash now includes more optimizations!
    - This means you can expect a drastic increase in performance, especially on lower-end machines.
- These optimizations are now included for Mac users as of **v1.1.6.3**.

- Fixed a major issue causing the client to close without any indication as to why during District switches.
- Fixed an issue where multiple clients could share the same log file.
- Improved various conditions in which the loading screen could get unintentionally stuck.
