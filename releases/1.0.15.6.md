# 1.0.15.6 BETA

**Break the Law**
- The Resistance has recovered anâ€¦ interesting painting of the Chairman, perhaps it might hold clues to something?
- The Resistance has started making early preparations for the transition into Phase Three of Operation: Break the Law!

**Lawbot Stand-In**
- The Resistance has added extra firepower to the canons in the Jury Round of the battle!
- - Fire toons into the Cog Jury Members before they can take a seat in the stands!
- - - Bumpy will refresh toons of this new change before the Jury Round starts.
- - - Destroying Cogs in this manner rewards some additional Lawbot Department Experience.

**Department Experience**
- Department Experience now is rewarded with diminishing returns.
- - In response to this new mechanic, values for experienced earned have been rebalanced across the board! Many values have been buffed and nerfed.
- - Example: In the VP, the first stun rewards a decent amount of experience; but over time toons learn less and less experience per stun on the VP.


**Misc**
- Various accessory tweaks.
