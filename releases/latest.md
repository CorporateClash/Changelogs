### Beta v1.1.6

**Optimization**
- Corporate Clash now includes more optimizations!
  - This means you can expect a drastic increase in performance, especially on lower-end machines.
  - Please note that these optimizations will only apply to Windows machines at the moment. Similar optimizations for Mac users will be coming in the near future!

**Toonseltown**
- The Present Thief minigame has received a few more tweaks!
  - Removed Cogs’ nametags and shadows to improve performance.
  - Micromanagers will no longer appear, as they were too small to hit easily and are difficult to see without nametags or shadows.
  - Fixed a crash that occurred at the start of the minigame if you had teleported to someone in Toonseltown.
  - Presents picked up at the end of the minigame should no longer cause a present to permanently appear above your laff meter.

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed a crash that could occur if someone in a Cog battle disconnected during gag selection.
- Fixed a crash that could occur if someone disconnected at the same moment you viewed their “Last Online” information.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the CFO’s head to be on backwards in the final cutscene of his boss battle.
  - He just liked wearing it backwards, we guess.
- Fixed crashes caused by the Toonseltown sidetask “ELF Improvement”.
