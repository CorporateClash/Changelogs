### Beta v1.1.2.1

**Update on November 9th, 2020**: After this initial patch, we introduced another fix that fixes an issue
 where a Toon can get stuck in the void in Cog Golf Courses.

**Bugfixes**
- **Fixed a major issue causing disconnects when switching Districts.**
  - Please let us know if you still encounter this issue!
- Fixed a few inconsistencies with Cog death animations.
- Toons should no longer fall asleep while browsing the Shtickerbook.
- Fixed an issue that would cause the entrance to the Lawfice Lobby to notify Toons that they don’t have enough Patents to enter. Of course they don’t have enough!
- Fixed an issue that would cause Daily Boosters to notify the toon of the wrong remaining time when 30 minutes were left.
- Fixed an issue preventing some Toons from receiving single alternate Cog Summons.
- Summoned normal Cogs can no longer spawn as alternates.
- Minor text fixes.
