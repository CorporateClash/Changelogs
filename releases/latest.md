### v1.0.11.1 BETA

**Tweaks**
- Zap's prioritization mechanics have been reworked!
- - Zap now prioritizes its direction to the left side instead of the right side. Toons will need to update their strategies!
- - Zap no longer prioritizes prestiged Zap gags to go before non-prestiged Zap gags.

**Bugfixes**
- The Toons over at The Gag Shop have been working on Zap gags, again!
- - Fixed visual bugs with Zap. Most if not all animations should now play properly!
- - - Zap may still have problems, so if you experience any unexpected issues with Zap, please report them to us!
- Fixed multiple issues on the District Page.
- - If there are still any problems related to the District Page, please report them to us and attach crash logs if available!
- Fixed a crash with players using the new Gag GUI.
- Replaced the lock on the construction site so cogs can no longer sneak in.
- Fixed an issue where The Trolley Gag Shop would take beans from your jellybean bank first.
