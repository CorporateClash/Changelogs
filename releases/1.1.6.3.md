### Beta v1.1.6.3

**Optimization**
- The following was introduced in v1.1.6, but we felt it was important enough to keep in the next Patch Notes as well since this patch came out shortly afterwards:
  - Corporate Clash now includes more optimizations!
    - This means you can expect a drastic increase in performance, especially on lower-end machines.
- These optimizations are now included for Mac users as of **v1.1.6.3**.

**New Years**
- Happie Newbear, Pawst Midnight, and Jan Furrst are back once again to set up fireworks for the new years!
- A fireworks show will start every hour on the dot in every Playground!
- Talk to Happie Newbear for a new years’ exclusive task that awards a New Years 2021 outfit.
  - This task will be available through the 3rd of January.

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed numerous more crashes that can happen if a Toon disconnects during gag selection.
- Fixed another crash that could rarely occur when a user exits Toonseltown.
- Fixed some issues that could occur if a user disconnected at the time of a Cog attack displaying.
- Temporarily disabled Discord integration in-game.
  - We believe this may be the cause of some weird crashes during Teleporting/District switching. If you’re still encountering this, please let us know.
- The server maintenance we performed in the last update has mitigated a few issues.
  - This has fixed issues like a District reset causing other Districts to hang and Invasions sometimes causing slight lag bursts.
