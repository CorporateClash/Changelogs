### General In-Game Rules
**Proof should be provided when reporting cases on any of these rules. Ban lengths will be determined by the severity of the case and/or infraction history.**

1. **NSFW talk is prohibited**. This includes any attempt to circumvent the chat filters in place in order to say blacklisted words, **especially, but not limited to swearing.**
    * The use of NSFW language in Toon names is also prohibited. Users who attempt to submit intentionally inappropriate names are liable to action being taken on their account.
2. **Spamming is prohibited**. This includes, but is not limited to: intentionally annoying other users by spamming the same/similar words/phrases, abusing the filter to create abnormally large speedchat bubbles repetitively. As a temporary solution, you can ignore the toon in question. If reported and the user in question is found guilty, a temporary mute may be applied to their account.
3. Bullying and harassment of other users is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to: name-calling, stalking and disruption of gameplay. 
4. Intentionally sabotaging gameplay for other users is not allowed. This includes:
    * Making choices in battle with the intention of causing other users to go sad, commonly referred to as greening.
    * Purposefully going inactive during battles. This includes, but is not limited to: lack of group consent when going inactive (regardless of how many toons you are running).
    * Purposefully disconnecting from a boss battle when dissatisfied with the reward without consent from the group before-hand, included but not limited to, SOS Shopping.
    * Intentionally finishing a cog facility before other members of your group, hence denying them progress towards their promotion.
