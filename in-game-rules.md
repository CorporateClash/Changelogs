### General In-Game Rules
**Proof should be provided when reporting cases on any of these rules. Ban lengths will be determined by the severity of the case and/or infraction history.**

1. **NSFW talk is prohibited**. This includes any attempt to circumvent the chat filters in place in order to say blacklisted words, **especially, but not limited to swearing.**
2. * The use of NSFW language in Toon or Club names is also prohibited. Users who attempt to submit intentionally inappropriate names are liable to action being taken on their account.
3. **Spamming is prohibited**. This includes, but is not limited to: intentionally annoying other users by spamming the same/similar words/phrases, abusing the filter to create abnormally large speedchat bubbles repetitively.

8. * Purposefully disconnecting from a boss battle when dissatisfied with the reward without consent from the group before-hand, included but not limited to, SOS Shopping.
9. * Intentionally finishing a cog facility before other members of your group, hence denying them progress towards their promotion.
