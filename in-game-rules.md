### General In-Game Rules
**Proof should be provided when reporting cases on any of these rules. Ban lengths will be determined by the severity of the case and/or infraction history.**

1. **Inappropriate conversations, as well as NSFW chat, is prohibited.** This includes, but is not limited to: political campaigning, discriminating against one’s race or religion, circumventing the filter to say blacklisted words (filter evasion), and general NSFW chat inappropriate for a family friendly setting.
    * Additionally, the use of NSFW or inappropriate language in Toon names is also prohibited. Corporate Clash reserves the right to take action on any user who intentionally submit inappropriate names.
2. **Excessive spamming is prohibited.** This includes, but is not limited to: intentionally annoying other users by spamming the same/similar words or phrases, abusing the filter to create abnormally large SpeedChat+ bubbles. As a temporary solution, you can ignore the Toon in question.
3. Bullying and harassment of other users is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to: name-calling, stalking and disruption of gameplay. 
4. Intentionally sabotaging gameplay for other users is not allowed. This includes:
    * Making choices in battle with the intention of causing other users to go sad, commonly referred to as greening.
    * Purposefully going inactive during battles. This includes, but is not limited to: lack of group consent when going inactive (regardless of how many toons you are running), or idling without communicating to a group you had to step away.
    * Purposefully disconnecting from a boss battle when dissatisfied with the reward without consent from the group before-hand, included but not limited to, SOS Shopping.
    * Intentionally finishing a cog facility before other members of your group, hence denying them progress towards their promotion.
    * While exploits are ultimately the responsibility of the Corporate Clash Crew, the use of glitches or exploits to disrupt the gameplay of others or grant an unfair advantage is prohibited. Those found to be performing glitches or exploits that can reset districts, or cause mass crashes may be subject to termination.
