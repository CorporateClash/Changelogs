### What we collect

Personally identifiable information:

* Your Username
* Your Email
* Your Password (unreadable by us, using industry standard [bcrypt hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt))
* IP Addreses used to access our services
* Browser user agents

### How we use this data

We need to collect this information to operate this service. 

* IP Addresses and browser user agents are required to prevent malicious abuse of our systems.
* The email, username and password fields are required to log users in and provide account security mechanisms.

This data is not given, sold, shared, or transferred to any third parties.

### Managing your data

We allow a user to request all information related to their account to be deleted upon request. A user may also request all of their information to be downloaded upon request. Requests can be made by emailing accounts@corporateclash.net. with the subject line being one of, although not limited to, the following:

* Account deletion request
* Account data download request
* Account data download and deletion request
* Stop processing my account’s data
* Withdrawal of data processing consent
* Withdrawal of TOS/Privacy Policy consent

Due to technical limitations, users can only request their information be downloaded, not directly transferred to a competitor.

Due to all collected data being required for an account to be operational, any user request related to withdrawal of data collection consent will result in the user's account being deleted (the user will be notified of this before their account is deleted).

For security and authentication purposes, we require the email be sent from the email on the account. Requests to delete accounts with emails different from the sender’s email will be denied. We may also deny requests for account deletion if we believe an email to be spoofed (via email spoofing services) or otherwise not sent from the account’s owner.

Upon a request being sent, we will verify the sender with a response email requiring one more confirmation that they would like their account be deleted. This is done to prevent email spoofing. After a reply email that confirms they want the account deleted, the account and all information on an account will be deleted within 1 month with a response email.

If a user decides to delete an account, and does not send another email before we delete the account to cancel the request, the user understands that their account and related information, including the user’s toons, will be permanently lost.

### Profiling and automated Decision Making

We do not perform profiling or automated decision making on users’ behalf beyond verifying that a user has authorized specific IP addresses to access their account. Users let us know themselves what IP addresses are authorized.

### Updates to this document

Users will be notified in advance of up to 15 days before updates to this privacy policy or our terms of service go into effect via email. We will include a condensed list of changes made, however, it is always recommended to view the changes in full.

Due to technical limitations, if a user decides they do not wish to comply to updates to our privacy policy or terms of service, users must perform a data deletion request as described above, and the user will be informed of this option in the notification email. Users who do not take action will automatically be bound to the new privacy policy terms upon the next use of our services.
