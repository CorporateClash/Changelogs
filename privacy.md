### Managing your data

We allow a user to request PII associated with their account to be deleted or downloaded via the website account page. Data downloads can only be performed every 30 days.

Due to technical limitations, users can only request their information be downloaded, not directly transferred to a competitor.

We may imose security and authentication checks during deletion or download requests to prevent unauthorized use of our system.

When a user deletes their account, the user understands that their account and related information, including access to the userâ€™s toons and other in-game content, will be permanently lost.

### Parental opt-out

If you are a parent or legal guardian, and would no longer like you or your child to be bound to this privacy policy, you may use the information above to delete your child's data. Since this information is required to operate the service, the account will be deleted. For security purposes, this can only be done by manually logging into the account and performing the deletion yourself. Your PII will no longer be stored on our systems once complete.
